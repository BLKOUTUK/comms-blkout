## Production Approach

**Option 1: Wan 2.6 I2V (Image-to-Video)**
1. Generate 4 key frame images (one per scene, hyper-real composites)
2. Use Wan I2V to animate each scene (15-20s clips)
3. Edit together into 60-90s complete video

**Option 2: Wan 2.6 T2V (Text-to-Video)**
- Generate each scene directly from text prompts
- May have less control over specific visuals
- Faster than I2V approach

**Recommendation**: I2V approach gives more control over specific imagery and maintains consistency with card aesthetic.
