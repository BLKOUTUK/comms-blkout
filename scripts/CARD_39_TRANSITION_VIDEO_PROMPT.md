## SCENE 1 (0-20s) — THE ANIMATED HEROES MONTAGE

**Visual Concept:**
Quick cuts of diverse X-Men 97 animated heroes from the journey (use generated cards)

**Sequence** (2-3 seconds each):
1. **Card 1 hero** (young, afro, purple hoodie) - isolated → looking up
2. **Card 3 hero** (fade, violet turtleneck) - observing → stepping forward
3. **Card 8 hero** (scholar, glasses, cardigan) - wisdom keeper
4. **Card 9 heroes** (two in conversation) - connection forming
5. **Card 14 hero** (club outfit, fem presentation) - confidence
6. **Card 32 hero** (activist, fist raised) - defiance
7. **Card 36 heroes** (two embracing) - healing
8. **Card 37 hero** (arms open to horizon) - possibility

**Editing Style:**
- Fast cuts with comic book wipe transitions
- Bold X-Men 97 aesthetic throughout
- Purple/gold/pink color palette
- Each hero distinct, showing range of presentations
- Building energy, heroic music

**Text Overlay** (appearing over montage):
"EVERY HERO DISTINCT"
"EVERY VOICE MATTERS"
"THIS IS US"

## SCENE 2 (20-40s) — TRANSITION TO REAL LIBERATION COLLECTIVE

**Visual Concept:**
Gradual crossfade from animated to real photography

**Sequence:**

**20-25s**: Last animated hero (Card 37 - arms open) begins to dissolve
- Cel-shaded outlines start fading
- Colors become more natural
- Animation style bleeds into realism

**25-35s**: Real Liberation Collective photos emerge
- Use actual BLKOUT community event photos
- Real people, real gatherings, real joy
- Same purple/gold lighting palette but photographic
- Show diversity: different ages, styles, authentic moments

**Photos to use** (2-3 seconds each):
1. Community gathering (people in circle)
2. Event celebration (hands raised, confetti)
3. Intimate conversation (two people talking)
4. Group laughter (authentic joy)
5. Solidarity moment (embrace, hands joining)

**Editing:**
- Smooth crossfade between animated and real
- Maintain energy but shift to documentary feel
- Real photos slightly slowed down for emotional impact
- Warm, authentic, present tense

**Text Overlay:**
"THE COLLECTIVE IS REAL"
"WE'VE BEEN BUILDING THIS"

## SCENE 3 (40-55s) — REAL YOU (The Distinct Invitation)

**Visual Concept:**
Final Liberation Collective photo dissolves to reveal YOU - distinct, real, direct

**40-45s**: Last collective photo fades
**45-55s**: Full frame of YOU
- Real photograph (not animated)
- Direct eye contact with camera OR powerful profile
- Natural lighting, unfiltered, authentic
- You as yourself - distinct from the animated heroes
- This is the crossover: from their story to yours

**Suggested Shot Options:**
1. **Direct address**: You looking at camera, slight smile, welcoming
2. **Powerful portrait**: Profile or 3/4, contemplative, grounded
3. **In action**: You at work/creating/organizing (shows what showing up looks like)

**Styling:**
- Natural lighting (golden hour or soft window light)
- Clothing: Authentic to you (not costume, just you)
- Environment: Simple, uncluttered (focus on face/presence)
- Color palette: Warm, earthy, grounded (contrast to vibrant animation)

**Text Overlay** (over your photo):
"WE'RE THE HEROES WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR."

**Pause** (2 seconds on your photo with text)

## SCENE 4 (55-60s) — THE INVITATION SETUP

**55-57s**: Your photo begins to transform
- Subtle animated outline appears around you
- Not full X-Men 97 style, just a hint
- Suggestion: "you could be in this story too"

**57-60s**: Quick preview of OOMF interface
- Comic book panel template appears
- Empty hero panel with silhouette
- Your photo/outline suggests where you'd go

**Final Text** (appears over OOMF preview):
"NOW PUT YOURSELF IN THE STORY."

**Fade to black** (0.5s) → Auto-scroll to Card 40 (OOMF embedded)
