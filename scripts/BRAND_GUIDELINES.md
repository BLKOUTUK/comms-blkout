## 🎨 Brand Colors - CORRECTED HARMONIOUS PALETTE

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Previous palette (Purple #a855f7, Gold #f59e0b, Green #10b981, Teal #14b8a6) did not work as complementary colors and has been replaced.

### PRIMARY: Purple Family Spectrum (Indigo → Electric Pink)
**Use for backgrounds, headings, gradients, and main brand elements**

```
Indigo (cool purple):    indigo-* (e.g., indigo-950, indigo-400)
Purple (core brand):     purple-* (e.g., purple-950, purple-400)
Violet (warm purple):    violet-* (e.g., violet-950, violet-400)
Fuchsia (purple-pink):   fuchsia-* (e.g., fuchsia-500, fuchsia-400)
Pink (electric pink):    pink-* (e.g., pink-500, pink-400)
```

**Gradient Examples (recognizably BLKOUT at a glance):**
- Hero backgrounds: `from-indigo-950 via-purple-950 to-violet-950`
- Headings: `from-indigo-400 via-purple-400 to-fuchsia-400`
- Dynamic text: `from-violet-400 via-fuchsia-400 to-pink-400`
- Buttons: `from-indigo-600 to-fuchsia-600`

### ACCENTS: Gold, Teal, Emerald (Use Sparingly)
**Use for highlights, secondary CTAs, and visual interest**

```
Gold:       amber-* (e.g., amber-400, amber-600)
Teal:       teal-* (e.g., teal-400, teal-500)
Emerald:    emerald-* (e.g., emerald-400, emerald-500)
```

**Accent Usage:**
- Partnership/community elements: amber-300, teal-300, emerald-300
- Secondary CTAs: Border with amber-400, hover to amber background
- Icon highlights: Use accent colors on specific icons for visual interest

### Design Voice Principles
**"Recognizably BLKOUT at a glance"** means:
1. **Purple dominance**: 70-80% purple family spectrum
2. **Accent highlights**: 20-30% gold/teal/emerald accents for contrast
3. **Font-black headings**: Bold, uppercase, high impact
4. **Font-light body text**: Readable, elegant, approachable
5. **Gradient depth**: Deep backgrounds (950), bright text (400-500)
- **Green (#10b981)**: Community, health, positive metrics
- **Teal (#14b8a6)**: Innovation, technology, secondary accents

### Gradients
Approved gradient combinations:
- Purple → Gold → Green (festive, celebratory)
- Purple → Teal (tech-forward, modern)
- Gold → Green (warm, community-focused)

### Accessibility
- Ensure text has minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against backgrounds
- Use white text on dark colors, dark text on light colors
- Test legibility at mobile sizes

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing logo** - Never ship a graphic without BLKOUT official logo
2. **Vague CTAs** - Always tell people exactly what to do next with URL
3. **App confusion** - Critical Frequency = mental health, Down = hook-up
4. **Over-complication** - Keep technical concepts simple and visual
5. **Missing URLs** - Always include BLKOUTUK.COM or specific landing page
6. **Poor contrast** - Text must be readable on all backgrounds
7. **Inconsistent branding** - Stick to approved colors and logo usage
