## SCENE 1 (0-20s) — The Team Assembles

**Wan 2.6 Prompt:**
```
X-Men 97 animation style. TITLE SEQUENCE ENERGY: Quick cuts of different Black queer men in heroic poses—each introduced with a flash of their "power" (one brings people together, one speaks truth, one creates art, one heals, one fights, one remembers). Classic team-assembly energy. Dynamic angles, bold colors, each hero distinct. Music building. This is the team. You could be on it.
```

**Technical Specs:**
- Duration: 20 seconds
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: I2V (image-to-video) - generate hero stills first, then animate

## SCENE 2 (20-40s) — What We've Built

**Wan 2.6 Prompt:**
```
X-Men 97 animation style. MONTAGE: Events happening (stylized versions of real BLKOUT moments). Articles being written (words flowing from fingers as light). The Hub pulsing with activity (digital space rendered as command center). New members joining (walking through the glowing door). The work visible, rendered as ongoing mission. Not finished—continuing. Each action a contribution to something larger.
```

**Technical Specs:**
- Duration: 20 seconds
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: T2V (text-to-video) or I2V with activity stills

## SCENE 3 (40-60s) — The Invitation

**Wan 2.6 Prompt:**
```
X-Men 97 animation style. Direct address: Multiple heroes turning to camera, breaking fourth wall. "We're building this." "Room for you." "If you want it." Each speaks directly to viewer. Warm, welcoming, not demanding. End on: an empty space in the team lineup—silhouette shaped like a person, glowing with potential. That space is for the viewer.
```

**Technical Specs:**
- Duration: 20 seconds
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: I2V - generate lineup still, animate characters turning to camera

## SCENE 4 (60-90s) — The Threshold

**Wan 2.6 Prompt:**
```
X-Men 97 animation style. Final sequence: The door, open, golden light pouring out. Camera pushes toward it—through it—into warmth. The team visible inside, active, alive. Camera settles on the empty hero silhouette. Text: "The damage is structural. The repair is relational." Beat. "Now put yourself in the story." The silhouette pulses, inviting.
```

**Technical Specs:**
- Duration: 20-30 seconds
- Resolution: 1920x1080
- Format: T2V with camera movement
- Text overlay: Add typography in post-production

## Production Workflow

2. **Use Wan I2V** to animate each scene (4 video clips)
3. **Edit together** to create 60-90s complete sequence
4. **Add audio**: Music build + voiceover if needed
5. **Add text overlays**: Final scene typography

## Direct Setup for Card 40 Crossover

This video leads DIRECTLY into Card 40 where:
- Video ends with pulsing silhouette
- Card 40 begins with Liberation Collective slideshow (animated heroes)
- Slideshow transitions to REAL photo of you
- CTA: "PUT YOURSELF IN THE STORY" → OOMF

**Narrative Arc**: Animated heroes → Real community → Real you → Your hero panel creation
