We built an Events Calendar that connected our community across the UK, a News Platform amplifying our voices, and a Communications Hub powered by four AI agents (Griot, Listener, Weaver, and Strategist) managing our storytelling.\n\nBut more than the tech, dear boy, we proved something revolutionary: AI doesn't have to be extractive. It can be liberatory. It can center Black queer agency, protect our data sovereignty, and enforce creator rights (75% of all revenue goes back to creators and community - that's not a goal, that's hardcoded into our system)."
