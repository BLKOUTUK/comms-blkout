```
🧵 Merry Christmas from BLKOUT, dear boy!

As 2025 winds down, let me tell you about the revolution we built together.

A thread on digital liberation, AI for good, and what's coming in 2026. 🎄✨

1/12
```

**Tweet 2/12:**
```
This year, we launched IVOR - UK's first Black queer AI assistant.

Not extractive tech. Not surveillance capitalism.

Just a culturally competent companion helping thousands of Black queer men find events, access wellness support, and connect with community. 🤖💛

2/12
```

**Tweet 3/12:**
```
We built an Events Calendar connecting Black queer men across London, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol.

Over 10,000 community members discovered gatherings, made friends, and found joy.

Because isolation ends when we step OUT OUT, dear boy. 📅🌍

3/12
```

**Tweet 4/12:**
```
Our News Platform amplified Black queer voices all year.

No more begging mainstream media to cover our stories. We ARE the media now.

Community-owned, community-governed, community-centered. 📰✊🏾

4/12
```

**Tweet 5/12:**
```
We embraced AI - but on OUR terms.

4 specialized agents (Griot, Listener, Weaver, Strategist) manage our communications.

Liberation Layer 3 ensures 75% of revenue goes to creators/community.

That's not aspiration - it's HARDCODED. 🔐💰

5/12
```

**Tweet 6/12:**
```
We formalized as a Community Benefit Society.

Democratic governance. Member ownership. Transparent operations.

This isn't a startup that'll get acquired by Big Tech.

This is an INSTITUTION for generations of Black queer men. 🏛️🏳️‍🌈

6/12
```

**Tweet 7/12:**
```
2026 is going to be WILD, dear boy.

We're launching Critical Frequency - think Grindr met Black Twitter met a liberation library.

Vibe-based matching. Safety-first design. No fetishization.

The social space Black queer men DESERVE. 🎵✨

7/12
```

**Tweet 8/12:**
```
Plus: Down - your wellness companion app.

Guided meditations, liberation journaling, chill playlists, community check-ins.

Mental health tools that actually understand what Black queer men face.

Coming Spring 2026. 🧘🏾📱

8/12
```

**Tweet 9/12:**
```
BLKOUT Shop launches January!

Liberation Journals, Black Queer Joy Zines, sustainable apparel, event tickets, + marketplace for Black queer vendors.

75% revenue to creators.

Because economic justice IS liberation. 🛍️💜

```

**Tweet 11/12:**
```
In 2025, we proved something revolutionary:

Black queer men can build technology that serves US. Governed by US. Owned by US.

No compromises. No VCs telling us to "scale."

Just community liberation, digitized. 🚀💛

11/12
```

**Tweet 12/12:**
```
Thank you for building this with us, dear boy.

Every event attended, every IVOR chat, every newsletter opened - you're the revolution.

Merry Christmas. Happy Holidays. The ancestors are smiling.
