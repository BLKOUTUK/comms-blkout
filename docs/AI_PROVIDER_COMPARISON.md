# AI Provider Cost Comparison & Brand Voice Consistency

**Date**: December 24, 2025
**Context**: Strategic evaluation of cheaper alternatives to Google Gemini for image/video generation
**Key Question**: How do we maintain recognizable BLKOUT brand voice across different AI providers?

---

## 🎯 Strategic Requirement

**Content must be recognizably BLKOUT at a glance, regardless of generation provider.**

Brand voice > provider choice. The validation layer enforces visual consistency whether we use:
- Google Gemini (current)
- Wan Video (proposed cheaper alternative)
- Any future AI provider

---

## 💰 Provider Comparison

### Current: Google Gemini
**Model**: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`
**Cost**: ~$0.05 per image (estimated, varies by resolution)
**Pros**:
- High quality outputs
- Good prompt adherence
- Official Google support
- Already integrated in comms-blkout

**Cons**:
- Higher cost per generation
- Can fabricate data (learned this the hard way)
- No inherent brand consistency
- Requires strict prompting for BLKOUT aesthetic

**Current Usage**: `/home/robbe/blkout-platform/apps/comms-blkout/scripts/generate-campaign-graphics-v2.ts`

---

### Proposed: Wan Video
**Model**: (needs research - multiple models available)
**Cost**: Significantly cheaper than Gemini (estimated 60-80% cost reduction)
**Pros**:
- Cost-effective for high-volume content
- Specialized in video generation (useful for TikTok, Reels, Stories)
- Supports multiple aspect ratios

**Cons**:
- Less established/documented than Gemini
- Quality consistency unknown
- Integration effort required
- May require more prompt engineering for BLKOUT aesthetic

**Status**: Not yet integrated

---

### Other Alternatives to Consider

**Stability AI (Stable Diffusion)**
- **Cost**: ~$0.02 per image
- **Pros**: Open source, highly customizable, can fine-tune models
- **Cons**: Requires more technical setup, quality varies

**Midjourney API** (if/when available)
- **Cost**: Subscription-based (~$30/month for basic, $60/month for standard)
- **Pros**: Exceptional visual quality, strong aesthetic consistency
- **Cons**: No official API yet, higher fixed cost

**DALL-E 3 (OpenAI)**
- **Cost**: ~$0.04 per image (1024x1024)
- **Pros**: High quality, good prompt following, fewer ethics issues
- **Cons**: Similar cost to Gemini, OpenAI API dependency

## 🎨 Brand Voice Consistency Strategy

### Problem
AI providers have different visual "styles" out of the box. Without guardrails:
- Gemini might generate one aesthetic
- Wan Video might generate a completely different look
- User sees inconsistent brand identity

### Solution: Validation Layer Enforces Consistency

**New ValuesCheck validation includes:**

1. **Brand Voice Recognizable** (required check)
   - Question: "Content is recognizably BLKOUT at a glance? (colors, typography, style)"
   - Help text: "Purple (#a855f7), Gold (#f59e0b), Green (#10b981), Teal (#14b8a6). IVOR voice: sophisticated wit meets Black British warmth."

2. **Visual Consistency** (required check)
   - Question: "Visual design matches BLKOUT brand guidelines? (regardless of AI provider)"
   - Help text: "Consistent aesthetic whether generated by Gemini, Wan Video, or other providers. Brand voice > provider."

**Human reviewers verify**:
- ✅ BLKOUT brand colors present
- ✅ Typography style consistent with guidelines
- ✅ Visual language recognizable as BLKOUT
- ✅ IVOR voice (if text overlay)
- ✅ "For and by us" aesthetic

**If content fails brand voice checks** → Reject and regenerate with better prompt engineering

## 📋 Implementation Plan for Multi-Provider Support

### Phase 1: Add Wan Video Support (Week 2)
1. Research Wan Video API documentation
2. Create `services/socialsync/providers/wanvideo.ts` service
3. Add provider selection to SocialSync UI
4. Test generation with same prompts across both providers
5. Validate brand consistency with ValuesCheck

### Phase 2: Provider Cost Analytics (Week 3)
1. Add cost tracking to `generated_assets` table:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE generated_assets ADD COLUMN generation_cost DECIMAL(10, 4);
   ALTER TABLE generated_assets ADD COLUMN provider VARCHAR(50);
   ```
2. Track actual costs per provider
3. Build analytics dashboard showing cost/quality tradeoffs
4. A/B test: Same prompt, different providers, measure:
   - Generation time
   - Cost
   - Pass rate through ValuesCheck
   - User preference

### Phase 3: Smart Provider Selection (Week 4)
1. Build logic to auto-select provider based on:
   - Content type (image vs video)
   - Aspect ratio (Wan Video better for video)
   - Priority (high priority = Gemini, medium = Wan Video)
   - Budget constraints
2. Override option for manual provider selection
3. Default to cheapest provider that maintains brand consistency

## 🚨 Critical Guardrails for Any Provider

**Before adding any new AI provider:**

1. **Brand Voice Test**: Generate 10 sample images with BLKOUT prompts
   - Do 80%+ pass ValuesCheck brand consistency requirements?
   - If no → Provider not suitable

2. **Data Fabrication Test**: Generate content with statistics
   - Does it invent fake data?
   - If yes → Add extra validation, never auto-approve

3. **Demographic Representation Test**: Generate content featuring people
   - Does it accurately represent Black queer men?
   - If no → Provider not suitable without extensive prompt engineering

4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
   - Cost per generation
   - Pass rate through ValuesCheck
   - Time to approval
   - **True cost = (generation cost) / (pass rate)**

## 💡 Brand Voice > Provider Choice

**Key Insight**: The validation layer makes us **provider-agnostic**.

As long as human reviewers enforce:
- ✅ BLKOUT colors (#a855f7, #f59e0b, #10b981, #14b8a6)
- ✅ Official logos (not AI-generated text)
- ✅ Factually accurate
- ✅ Demographically authentic
- ✅ Recognizably BLKOUT at a glance

...it doesn't matter if the content came from Gemini, Wan Video, Stable Diffusion, or any future provider.

**The human verification is the brand consistency layer.**

## 📊 Next Steps

**Immediate (Day 1-2)**:
- ✅ ValuesCheck component created with brand voice validation
- ✅ Integrated into SocialSyncEditorial approval workflow

**Week 2**:
- [ ] Research Wan Video API and pricing
- [ ] Create provider abstraction layer (`services/socialsync/providers/`)
- [ ] Add provider selection dropdown to SocialSync UI
- [ ] Test Wan Video generation with BLKOUT prompts

**Week 3**:
- [ ] Add cost tracking to database
- [ ] Build provider comparison analytics
- [ ] A/B test: Gemini vs Wan Video on same prompts

**Week 4**:
- [ ] Implement smart provider selection logic
- [ ] Document best practices per provider
- [ ] Update brand guidelines with provider-specific prompt patterns

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**We've succeeded when**:
1. Users can't tell which provider generated the content
2. All content passes brand voice validation
3. Cost per approved asset is 50%+ lower than Gemini-only
4. Pass rate through ValuesCheck is 80%+ for all providers
5. Team confidently uses multiple providers based on task requirements
